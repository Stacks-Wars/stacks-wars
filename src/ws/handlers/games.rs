//! Empty template for game-specific websocket handlers.

//! Add game-specific websocket handlers or re-exports here. This file is an
//! intentionally empty starting point for other developers to implement game
//! features that plug into the generic lobby system.

// Example placeholder re-export (uncomment when adding real handlers):
// pub use crate::games::my_game::ws_handler;

pub fn _placeholder() {
    // no-op: keeps file useful during scaffolding
}
